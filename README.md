# _NOW EAT_

#### _A web application designed to alleviate the stress of choosing a place to eat based on a matching system that compares destinations users select whether or not they would like to go_

#### By _Ryan Walker_

## Description
Now Eat is an application that will allow users to compare interests in restaurants and return those that match. Built with React/Redux, Now Eat uses the NoSQL cloud-hosted databases Firebase, for user authentication, and Firestore, for holding user data and information about restaurants. Users have the ability to create accounts, match with friends, and choose restaurants that they would like to eat at. Now Eat will take away all of the guess-work when it comes to deciding where to eat as a couple or a group.
